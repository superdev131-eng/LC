## Overview

Think of this tag as an all-purpose ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­Swiss Army Knife for fetching content. Give it one or more URLs and you'll receive all the data that would be injected automatically into the view if you visited it directly. It doesn't matter where the data comes from â€“ entry, taxonomy, route, controller, database, etc.

```
{{ get_content from="about/team" }}
  {{ team }}
    <div class="w-1/3">
      <img src="{{ headshot }}" alt="{{ name }}">
      <p>{{ name }}, {{ job_title }}</p>
    </div>
  {{ /team }}
{{ /get_content }}
```

## Shorthand

You may also use a shorthand syntax, where the second tag argument refers to a variable that contains a URL or ID.

```

related_by_url: /about
related_by_id: 123-321-abc-defg123

{{ get_content:related_by_url }}
  {{ title }}
{{ /get_content:related_by_url }}

{{ get_content:related_by_entry }}
  {{ title }}
{{ /get_content:related_by_entry }}
```
