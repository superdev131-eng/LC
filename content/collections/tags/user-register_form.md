## Overview

User tags are designed for sites that have areas or features behind a login. The `user:registration_form` tag helps you build a public registration form for new users.

The tag will render the opening and closing `<form>` HTML elements for you. The rest of the form markup is up to you as long as you have `email`, `password`, and `password_confirmation` input fields.

### Example

A basic registration form, with validation errors.

```
{{ user:register_form }}

    {{ if errors }}
        <div class="bg-red-300 text-white p-2">
            {{ errors }}
                {{ value }}<br>
            {{ /errors }}
        </div>
    {{ /if }}

    {{ if success }}
        <div class="bg-green-300 text-white p-2">
            {{ success }}<br>
        </div>
    {{ /if }}

    <label>Email</label>
    <input type="email" name="email" value="{{ old:email }}" />

    <label>Password</label>
    <input type="password" name="password" />

    <label>Password Confirmation</label>
    <input type="password" name="password_confirmation" />

    <button>Register</button>

{{ /user:register_form }}
```

## Additional Fields

You are allowed to add any additional fields to your registration form, and they will be added to the user's account provided that they exist in the `user.yaml` blueprint.

Any submitted data that does _not_ exist in the blueprint will be completely ignored.

Additional fields will be validated as per your blueprint `validate` rules.

## Dynamic Rendering

Instead of hardcoding individual fields, you may loop through the `fields` array to render fields more dynamically.

```
{{ fields }}
    <div class="p-2">
        <label>{{ display }}</label>
        <div class="p-1">{{ field }}</div>
        {{ if error }}
            <p class="text-gray-500">{{ error }}</p>
        {{ /if }}
    </div>
{{ /fields }}
```

Each item in the `fields` array contains `type`, `display` and `handle`, which are configurable from the `user` blueprint.

You will also find the field's `old` input on unsuccessful submission, as well as an `error` message when relevant.

Finally, the `field` value contains a pre-rendered form input.  Using this will intelligently render inputs as inputs, textareas as textareas, and snozzberries as snozzberries.  You can customize these pre-rendered templates by running `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=statamic-views`, which will expose editable templates in your `views/vendor/statamic/forms/fields` folder.

## New User Roles

Most of the time, new members will need some roles assigned to them so that they can do different things on your site. You can configure the default `new_user_roles` in your `config/statamic/users.php` config. When a user successfully registers as a member, their account will automatically be assigned the roles in this list.

Itâ€™s best to remember that these are _starting_ roles for the user. You can later either manually add roles to users in their files, update their account through the Control Panel, or have add-ons automatically add or remove roles as needed when users perform certain tasks.
