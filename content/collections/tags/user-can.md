## Example {#example}

We want to show a link to the control panel if the user has the `cp:access` permission.

```
{{ user:can permission="cp:access" }}
    <a href="/cp">Control Panel</a>
{{ /user:can }}
```

If the user doesn't have the permission, the content between the tags simply won't be rendered.

A shorthand syntax is also available, however this only allows checking against a single permission:

```
{{ can:cp:access }}
    <a href="/cp">Control Panel</a>
{{ /can:cp:access }}
```

### Canâ€™t

We also support the inverse using `{{ user:cant }}` tags.
