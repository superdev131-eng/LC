## Example

Here's an example of what breadcrumbs might look like, as well as a code example in use.

![img](/assets/img/other/breadcrumbs.png) {width=450}

``` php
<ul class="breadcrumbs">
    {{ nav:breadcrumbs }}
    <li{{ if is_current }} class="current"{{ /if }}>
        <a href="{{ url }}">{{ title }}</a>
    </li>
    {{ /nav:breadcrumbs }}
</ul>
```
