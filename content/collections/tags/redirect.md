## Redirecting to URLs

Let's redirect visitors to the homepage if they're not logged in.
```
{{ if ! logged_in }}
  {{ redirect to="/" }}
{{ /if }}
```

How about RickRolling visitors if it's April Fool's Day?
```
{{ if (now|format:m-d) == "04-01" }}
  {{ redirect to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" }}
{{ /if }}
```


## Named Routes

You may redirect to named routes with the `route` parameter. Anything else will be passed along as route parameters.

```php
Route::get('products/{product}/{size}', fn($product, $size) => ...)
     ->name('products.show');
```

```
{{ redirect route="products.show" product="socks" size="large" }}
// /products/socks/large
```
