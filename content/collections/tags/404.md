## Overview

The most common use cases for the 404 tag is for checking if a user is logged in or has performed an action before displaying a particular page.

```
{{ if ! logged_in }}
  {{ 404 }}
{{ /if }}

{{ if ! success }}
  {{ 404 }}
{{ /if }}
```

If you'd rather perform a _redirect_ instead of throwing a 404, you can use the [redirect tag](/tags/redirect).

> There's no need to wrap the rest of the template in an else condition.
