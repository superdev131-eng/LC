## Overview
The various Nav tags work together to allow you to easily traverse your content upways and downways, sideways, slantways, longways, backways, squareways, frontways, and any other ways that you can think of.

This tag is designed to be used for top-level and multi-level navs.

## Navs or Collections

The nav tag supports both [navigations](/navigation) or multi-depth [collections](/collections).

You specify what kind you need by using the second tag part:

```
// The "links" nav
{{ nav:links }} ... {{ /nav:links }}
```

```
// The "pages" collection
{{ nav:collection:pages }} ... {{ /nav:collection:pages }}
```

If you use the tag on it's own without a second part, it will assume you want the `pages` collection. That's a super common thing to do, and the `statamic/statamic` repo comes bundled with it.

```
// Also the "pages" collection
{{ nav }} ... {{ /nav }}
```

## Basic Example

A single level nav, much like something you'd have at the top of your site, can be built by looping through all the items in the nav and using their `title` and `url` variables in your HTML. Add a "current" state by checking for `is_current` and `is_parent`, and you're probably good to go.
```
<ul>
  {{ nav include_home="true" }}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ url }}"{{ if is_current || is_parent }} class="current"{{ /if }}>
        {{ title }}
      </a>
    </li>
  {{ /nav }}
</ul>
```

## Multi-level Nav Example Recursion {#multi-level}

Build an infinitely deep nav is possible by using recursion.

```
<ul>
   {{ nav from="/{segment_1}" max_depth="2" }}
      <li>
         <a href="{{ url }}"{{ if is_current || is_parent }} class="on"{{ /if }}>{{ title }}</a>
         {{ if is_current || is_parent }}
            {{ if children }}
               <ul>{{ *recursive children* }}</ul>
            {{ /if }}
         {{ /if }}
      </li>
   {{ /nav }}
</ul>
```

The `{{ *recursive children* }}` tag will repeat the contents of the entire `{{ nav }}` tag using child elements, if they exist. As long as there are children to display, and weâ€™re still on either the current or parent page of those children, the nav tag will traverse deeper. If your scoped variables have trouble making it through to the next recursion, you can glue them to children like this: `{{ *recursive children:my_scoped_variable* }}`.

Take the time to wrap your brain around this concept and learn to wield it and a powerful Jedi will you be.
