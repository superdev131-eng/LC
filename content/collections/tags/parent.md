## Overview

This is a simple utility tag that makes it easy to fetch data from the entry one page above the current entry. It's useful for creating section headers, simple breadcrumbs, and so on.

## Parent URL
By itself the tag returns the parent's URL.

```
{{ parent }}
// Would return "/tags"
```

## Single Variables
You can fetch single variables from the parent entry by passing them as the second tag argument.

```
{{ parent:title }}
// Would return "Tags"
```

## Tag Pair
As a tag pair, it will have access to all the parent's data:

```
{{ parent }}
  Go back to <a href="{{ url }}">{{ title }}</a>.
{{ /parent }}
```

``` output
Go back to <a href="/tags">Tags</a>.
```
