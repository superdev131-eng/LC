## Overview

The assets fieldtype is used to manage and relate files with your entries. From the fieldtype you can manage custom fields on the assets themselves (learn more about that in the [assets guide](/assets)), preview full size images or rich media files, and even set focal points for cropping.

Files are rearrangeable via drag-and-drop.

## UI Modes

The list mode is shown above, while the grid mode is below. There are no functional differences, only visual ones. List mode is more compact â€“ useful if you're not primarily managing images.
