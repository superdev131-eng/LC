## Overview

The most common use for the Users fieldtype is to manage the "author" for entries, but it's hardly the only case. You could...

- List people who contributed to a project
- Link to related authors
- Manage an "Employee of the Weekend" section. Everyone wants to be the King or Queen of Inventory Saturday.
- Display team bios

## Data Structure

The Users fieldtype is a [relationship fieldtype](/fieldtypes/relationship) â€“ which mean the data will store a reference to the users IDs to main a dynamic link.

``` .language-yaml
author: abc-123-cba-321
```

## Templating

All relationship fields use [augmentation](/augmentation) to fetch the actual data objects, allowing you to interact with the related data automatically and dynamically.

```
<div class="bg-white p-4 shadow flex items-center">
{{ author }}
  <img class="w-10 h-10 rounded-full" src="{{ avatar }}" alt="Avatar of {{ name }}">
    <div class="text-sm ml-4">
      <p class="text-gray-900 leading-none">{{ name }}</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600">{{ email }}</p>
    </div>
{{ /author }}
</div>
```

``` output
<div class="bg-white p-4 shadow flex items-center">
  <img class="w-10 h-10 rounded-full" src="/img/avatars/david.jpg" alt="Avatar of David Hasselhoff">
    <div class="text-sm ml-4">
      <p class="text-gray-900 leading-none">David Hasselhoff</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600">thehoff@statamic.com</p>
    </div>
</div>
```
