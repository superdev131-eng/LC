## Usage

This fieldtype is used to view a list of Users, generally to establish who authored a given entry or page. Setting the default to `current` will use the currently logged in User.

```.language-yaml
fields:
  author:
    display: Author
    type: users
```

## Data Structure

The Users fieldtype is a [Relate fieldtype](/fieldtypes/relate), which means the users will be saved asÂ IDs.

``` .language-yaml
jedis:
  - 892jfsd9a90as
  - 134jk1h78dfas
```

## Templating

Use the [Relate tag](/tags/relate) to loop through the IDs and fetch the user data.

```
<ul>
  {{ relate:jedis }}
    <li>{{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}</li>
  {{ /relate:jedis }}
</ul>
```

``` .language-output
<ul>
  <li>Luke Skywalker</li>
  <li>Yoda</li>
</ul>
```
