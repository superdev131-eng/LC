You can hit `enter` or `tab` to add a tag; navigate through tabs with your arrow keys; use `backspace` or click
the `x` to delete tags; and drag and drop tags to rearrange them.

Your tags will get saved as a simple YAML list, like this:

``` .language-yaml
- Bears
- Beets
- Battlestar Galactica
```

Note: This fieldtype uses "Tags" in general terms. If you're looking for a way to tag/taxonomize your content, you
may be interested in checking out [taxonomies](/taxonomies) and the [Taxonomy fieldtype](/fieldtypes/taxonomy).
