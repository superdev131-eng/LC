## Overview

Use this fieldtype to create a one-way relationship with one or more structures in your site. It's a simple-little-helper type of thing.

:::tip
[Structures](/structures) come in two flavors: Ordered Collections and Navigations.
:::

## Data Storage

The Structures fieldtype stores the `handle` of a single structure as a string, or an array of handles if `max_items` is greater than 1.

``` yaml
structures:
  - main_nav
  - footer
  ```

## Templating

Loop through the structures to  access their handles and pass them to a [Nav](/tags/nav) tag.

```
{{ structures }}
  <ul>
    {{ nav :handle="handle" }}
      <li><a href="{{ url }}">{{ title }}</a></li>
    {{ /nav }}
  </ul>
{{ /structures }}
```

```html
<ul>
  <li><a href="/look-at-this">Look at This!</a></li>
  <li><a href="/look-at-that">Wait, Look at That!</a></li>
</ul>
```
