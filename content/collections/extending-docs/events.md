  Events serve as a great way to decouple various aspects of the application, or even modify behavior or output of core functionality. A single event can have multiple listeners that do not depend on each other.

## Overview {#overview}

Statamic will dispatch a number of events in various locations throughout the codebase.

In a nutshell, you'd create an event listener or subscriber, connect them together in a service provider, then handle the event.

``` php
protected $listen = [
    'SomeEvent' => [
        'SomeListener',
    ],
];
```
``` php
class SomeListener
{
    public function handle(SomeEvent $event)
    {
        //
    }
}
```

Consult the [Laravel event documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/events) for a more in-depth explanation on events.

If you're creating an addon, you can quickly [register event listeners or subscribers](/extending/addons#events).

## Available Events

### Data Events

Statamic will dispatch a number of "data events" when things are modified throughout the system. Typically these are for content (e.g. collections and entries) or resources (e.g. blueprints and form submissions).

They all work the same way in that the item will be available in the event's `$item` property.

``` php
public function handle(EntrySaved $event)
{
    $entry = $event->item;
}
```

- "Saving" events are dispatched _before_ the item is about to be saved.
- "Saved" events are dispatched _after_ the item is saved.
- "Deleted" events are dispatched after the item is deleted. The file would have already been deleted at this point so the item only exists in memory.

Classes:

- `Statamic\Events\Data\AssetContainerDeleted`
- `Statamic\Events\Data\AssetContainerSaved`

- `Statamic\Events\Data\EntrySaving`
- `Statamic\Events\Data\FieldsetDeleted`

- `Statamic\Events\Data\UserGroupDeleted`
- `Statamic\Events\Data\UserGroupSaved`
- `Statamic\Events\Data\UserSaved`

### PublishBlueprintFound
`Statamic\Events\PublishBlueprintFound`

Dispatched after Statamic finds the blueprint to be used on a publish page.

You may modify the blueprint here and it will be reflected in the publish form.
An example of when this would be useful is to add a section to a blueprint in the publish page on the fly.

``` php
public function handle(PublishBlueprintFound $event)
{
    $event->blueprint; // The Blueprint object
    $event->type;      // A string describing the form where it's being used. e.g. "entry"
    $event->data;      // The item. e.g. an Entry object.
}
```


### ResponseCreated
`Statamic\Events\ResponseCreated`

Dispatched after Statamic finishes creating the response to send to the front-end.
You may wish to modify the response to add headers, etc.

``` php
public function handle(ResponseCreated $event)
{
    $event->response; // The Response object
}
```

### FormSubmitted
`Statamic\Events\Data\FormSubmitted`

Dispatched when a [Form](/forms) is submitted on the front-end, before the Submission is created.

``` php
public function handle(FormSubmitted $event)
{
    $event->item; // The Submission object
}
```

You can `return false` to prevent the submission, but appear to the user as though it succeeded.

If you'd like to show validation errors, you may throw an `Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException`:

``` php
throw new ValidationException::withMessages(['You did something wrong.']);
```

You may also just modify the submission object. You do not need to `return` anything.
