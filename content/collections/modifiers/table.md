Takes an array generated by the [Table Fieldtype](/fieldtypes/table), and converts into a basic HTML `<table>`.

``` .language-yaml
my_table:
  -
    cells:
      - One
      - Two
  -
    cells:
      - Three
      - Four
```

```
{{ my_table | table }}
```

``` .language-output
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>One</td>
        <td>Two</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Three</td>
        <td>Four</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

You can pass `true` as an argument to parse the cell data as markdown.

```
{{ my_table | table:true }}
```
