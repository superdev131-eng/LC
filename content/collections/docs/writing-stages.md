## 1. Gathering Knowledge

In this phase we're gathering data, important information, code examples, noting any important steps, and ensuring we don't forget things that might not be obvious after a time.

No editing has taken place and there is no real "flow" to the content. It's merely a brain dump for Future Jackâ„¢ to deal with.

## 2. Working on Draft

This is where a page starts to gain an outline, intro and overview text is added, and existing content is rewritten and rephrased.

## 3. Ready for Editing

This is where do our best to make sure the page covers all the scope it needs to, the words flow and read well, and is structured properly and consistently.

## 4. Needs Polish & Humor

Time to check for correctness, formatting, grammar, and spelling issues, and ensure the structure is consistent with similar pages.

And then we layer on the humor when and where we can. We love docs that are fun to read, as long as the humor don't get in the way.

## 5. Ready for Feedback

Time to assess and receive feedback. If anything is unclear, we'll move back through whichever steps are needed to bring this page to perfection.

## Complete

Literal perfection achieved. This page might as well be a Matrix-level mind-download or Vulcan Mind Meld.
