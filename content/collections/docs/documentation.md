## Before You Start

Remember that Statamic 3 is in a _pre-beta_ state. **You will** encounter bugs, typos, missing documentation, and unclear instructions. If you spend any amount of time working with v3, you will likely find yourself confused, frustrated, or stuck.

## Your Mission

Your mission -- should you choose to accept it -- is to provide feedback whenever you get confused or stuck so we can smooth out, rewrite, or fix whatever tripped you up.

We need the outside perspective that you can bring to help us get into (and back out of) beta. There are **fundamental changes** to the way some features work, how to configure your site, the names of things, and so on.

There are new features that need testing, documentation that needs reading (and writing &mdash; we're working on that right now), and workflows that need using.

If you're able and willing to help us with these things, we will be forever grateful. Statamic's successful future will have you to thank.

## Not for Production Use

**This cannot be stated loudly enough. Statamic 3 Alpha is NOT for production use.** There may be more <mark>breaking changes</mark> coming which could result in large amounts of manual work needed to get a site back in sync. You may encounter show-stopping bugs. You will almost definitely regret it.

So when you're tempted to launch that site you built anyway even after reading this warning, just remember &mdash; we told you not to do it, we still love you, and you're on own.

## What You See...

May not be part of Statamic core when we launch 3.0. Some features may be extracted into addons, renamed, moved around, or removed completely. Keep that in mind.

## Providing Feedback

üêõIf you encounter anything looks, smells, feels, or tastes like a **bug**, open an issue on the main [`statamic/three-cms`](https://github.com/statamic/three-cms) repo.

üí°If you have an **idea** on how to improve the way something works, open an issue on the [`statamic/ideas`](https://github.com/statamic/ideas) repo.

üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èIf you have a **feature request**, we ask that you save it for later. We're feature locked and don't want to push the launch out any further than necessary. There will be plenty of time for great new, _new_ things in the near future.

## Areas NOT Ready for Feedback

Before you start opening Github Issues, here are a few areas we know aren't finished. Some are in progress and others will need to wait until after the git repos are public.

- The **Control Panel** is not fully responsive. Please only use it on Desktop for now.
- The **install process** is temporary, an unfortunate necessity when dealing with private git repos.
- The **Updater**, while functional, won't do much until the repo is public.
- **Multi-user editing** is a separate addon not included in this Alpha.
- **These docs** are unfinished and very rough. Hang in there, Jack gets through about 4-6 pages a day. If you're interested in more reading, we have even rougher [wip docs](https://statamic3-docs.netlify.com) we used to catch brain dumps during development.
