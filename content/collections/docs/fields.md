template: page
intro: All managed content is entered into fields. They come in many types, from basic text and select boxes, to rich text fields, and image fields. Fields have common and unique settings, can be grouped into blueprints and fieldsets, and can be translated.

## Common Settings

All fields share the following settings:

- **Display** â€“ The field's label shown throughout the Control Panel
- **Handle** â€“ The field's variable name used in templates
- **Instructions** â€“ Help text shown to your authors
- **Type** â€“ The type of field it is
- **Localizable**Â â€“ Whether the field can be translated in other sites

## Blueprints and Fieldsets

[Blueprints](/blueprints) determine what fields are shown in your publish forms. You can configure the fields order, each field's width, and group them into sections and tabs.

Blueprints are attached to collections, taxonomies, global sets, assets, users, and even forms, all which help to determine their content schema.

[Fieldsets](/fieldsets) are used to store and organize **reusable fields**. Blueprints can reference fields or entire fieldsets, helping you keep your configurations nice and [DRY][dry].

## Field Types

A fields input UI and storage format is determined by it's [fieldtype](/fieldtypes). Statamic includes 40+ fieldtypes to help you tailor the perfect intuitive experience for your authors.

## Data Storage & Augmentation {#augmentation}

Each field type has its own data storage format. Text and Markdown fields store strings, lists and YAML fields store arrays, Bard stores ProseMirror document objects, and so on.

Each fieldtype has the ability to _augment_ this data when accessed from the front-end of your site, transforming it whatever format is most appropriate.  In Statamic v2 this would need to be done manually through the use of [modifiers](/modifiers). For example:

- **Asset** fields will return Asset objects with access to meta data and any additional fields
- **Bard** fields will transform ProseMirror document objects into an array of structured data and HTML.
- **Markdown** fields will automatically parse content and return HTML.
- **Relationship** fields will return the content objects of the entries they refer to.

> **Augmentation** is only performed when a field is defined in a blueprint. Data created on the fly in Front Matter may still require modifiers to transform it accordingly.

## Localization

Fields can be localized, allowing you to translate or modify content in a multi-site project.

For example, you're building the website for a multi-national company with headquarters in the United States, UK, and Germany.

- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ The "base" site the US/English version, and all content is created while with that location and audience in mind.

- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ In the UK version you only need to localize a few fields, replacing "color" and "favorite" with "colour" and "favourite", as well as update company phone numbers and addresses.

- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª In the German version of the site, however, all written content would need to be translated.

To accomplish this you can configure your Statamic install as a multi-site instance, enable localization on all appropriate fields, and switch between sites with the site switcher dropdown in the global nav, or the locale list in the sidebar of your publish forms.
