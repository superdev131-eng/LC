## Overview

Forms are a natural part of the internet experience and a core component of most websites in some shape or form. From "Contact Us" to "Vote for Your Favorite Porg", Statamic can help manage your forms and make your life a little easier.

Statamic forms serve to collect, report, and reuse user submitted data. The end-to-end solution includes Tags, settings, and a dedicated area of the Control Panel. And yes, "Forms" is a pretty boring title. But at least it's fairly clear as to what it does.

## Your First Form

Let's pretend you're are a famous celebrity with a large following of dedicated fans. If this is true, why are you building your own website? Who's going to sail your yacht?

Okay, let's just pretend you're a famous celebrity's _web developer_. You've been tasked with collecting electronic fan mail (we'll call it EF-Mail). You want to collect the following bits of info from <del>crazed</del> enthusiastic fans:

- name
- age
- level of adoration (appreciation, fixation, or obsession)
- message

### Create the form

First, head to `/cp/forms` in the Tools area of the Control Panel and click the **Create Form** button. Alternately you can create a `.yaml` file in `site/settings/formsets` which will contain all the form fields and settings.

Each form should contain a title and a reference to a [blueprint](blueprints). Optionally it may also have metrics and email configuration.

```yaml
title: Super Fans
blueprint: super_fans
```

### The Blueprint

The [blueprint](blueprints) is where you define your form's `fields` and validation rules to be used on form submission.

```yaml
fields:
  -
    handle: name
    field:
      display: Name
      type: text
      validate: required
  -
    handle: age
    field:
      display: Age
      type: text
      validate: required|integer
  -
    handle: adoration
    field:
      display: Level of Adoration
      type: text
      validate: required
  -
    handle: message
    field:
      display: Message
      type: textarea
      validate: required
```

### The Template

Several [form tags](tags/form) are provided to help you render your form.  You can explore these at your leisure, but here is a basic example of a form template.

```
{{ form:super_fans }}

    {{ if errors }}
        <div class="bg-red-300 text-white p-2">
            {{ errors }}
                {{ value }}<br>
            {{ /errors }}
        </div>
    {{ /if }}

    {{ if success }}
        <div class="bg-green-300 text-white p-2">
            {{ success }}
        </div>
    {{ /if }}

    {{ fields }}
        <div class="p-2">
            <label>{{ display }}</label>
            <div class="p-1">{{ field }}</div>
            {{ if error }}
                <p class="text-gray-500">{{ error }}</p>
            {{ /if }}
        </div>
    {{ /fields }}

{{ /form:super_fans }}
```

## Viewing Submissions

The Control Panel enables you to explore the collected responses, configure dashboards with reporting metrics, and export the data to CSV or JSON formats.

![Forms](/assets/img/screenshots/cp-forms.jpg) {.rounded}

You can jump back into your form's settings and pick which fields you want shown, as well as configure metrics you'd like shown above your responses. **Here's an example:**

![Metrics](/assets/img/screenshots/cp-metrics.jpg) {.rounded}

These metrics would have a configuration like this:

```language-yaml
metrics:
  -
    type: total
    label: Total Responses
  -
    type: average
    field: rating
    label: Average Rating
    precision: 1
  -
    type: average
    field: age
    label: Average Age
    precision: 1
```

You can apply `average`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, and `total` metrics to any applicable field in your form.

## Displaying submission data

You can display any or all of the submissions of your forms on the front-end of your site using the [form submissions][submissions] Tag.

```
<h2>My fans have said some things you can't forget...<h2>
{{ form:submissions in="superfans" limit="15" }}
  {{ message | markdown }}
{{ /form:submissions }}
```

## Exporting your data

Exporting your data is as easy as click the **Export** button when viewing your form in the Control Panel. You have the choice between CSV and JSON. Choose wisely.

## Emails

Allowing your fans to send their comments is all well and good, but at this point you will only know about it when you
head back into the Control Panel to view the submissions. Wouldn't it be better to get notified? It's simple to send
an email when a form is submitted.

You can add any number of emails to your formset.

``` .language-yaml
email:
  -
    to: hello@celebrity.com
    from: website@celebrity.com
    subject: You've got fan mail!
    template: fan-mail
  -
    to: agent@celebrity.com
    subject: Someone still likes your client
    automagic: true
```

Here we'll send two emails for every submission of this form. One will go to the celebrity, and one to the agent.
The first one uses a Statamic template, the other gets an "automagic" email. The automagic email will be a simple
list of all the fields and values in the submission.

### Setting the Recipient Dynamically

You can set the recipient to an address submitted in the form by using the variable in your config block. Assuming you have a form input with `name="email"`:

``` .language-yaml
email:
  -
    to: "{{ email }}"
    # other settings here
```

### Setting the "Reply To" Dynamically

You can set the "reply to" to an address submitted in the form by using the variable in your config block. Assuming you have a form input with `name="email"`:

``` .language-yaml
email:
  -
    reply_to: "{{ email }}"
    # other settings here
```

## File Uploads

Sometimes your fans want to show you things they've created, like scissor-cut love letters and innocent selfies with cats. No problem! File input types to the rescue. Inform Statamic you intend to collect files, specify where you'd like the uploads to go, and whether you'd like them to simply be placed in a directory somewhere, or become reusuable Assets.

First up, add `files="true"` to  your form tag. (This will add `enctype="multipart/form-data"` to the generated `<form>` tag. That's always so difficult to remember.)

```
{{ form:create formset="contact" files="true" }}
...
{{ /form:create }}
```

Then the fields:

```
<input type="file" name="simple" />
<input type="file" name="fancy" />
```

``` .language-yaml
fields:
  simple:
    type: file
    destination: uploads/
  fancy:
    type: asset
    container: uploads
    folder: fan-art
```

**Simple Uploads**: Set `type: file` and a `destination` (path from webroot). That's it.

**Asset Uploads**: Set `type: asset`, specify the asset `container` via handle or ID, and which folder inside said container.

### Multiple files

You have two methods available to you:

First, You can create separate fields for each upload. This is useful if each has a separate purpose, like Resume, Cover Letter, and Headshot. You'll need to explicitly create each and every one in your formset.

Or, you can enable multiple files on one field, by setting type with the plural form of the type option, `files` or `assets`, and indicating an array in your input by adding a set of square brackets to the `name` attribute.

```
<input type="file" name="many[]" multiple />
```

``` .language-yaml
fields:
  many:
    type: files
    destination: uploads/
```

> If you use the square bracket `name` syntax, but use the singular `type` in your formset, only the first selected file will be uploaded. Don't forget to set both.

## Honeypot

Simple and effective spam prevention.

The honeypot technique is simple. Add a field to your forms, that when filled in will cause the submission to fail.
Hide this field a method of your choosing (ie. CSS), so your users won't see it but spam bots will just think itâ€™s another field.

For example:

```
{{ form:create }}
    ...
    <input type="text" name="honeypot" class="honeypot" />
{{ /form:create }}
```

``` .language-css
.honeypot { display: none; }
```

If you're worried about smarter spam bots realizing that the honeypot field is named `honeypot`, you may customize the
name of the field by adding `honeypot: something` to your formset.

> We say the submission will "fail", but that's not **exactly** true. On the front end it will appear that the form was submitted successfully. However, nothing will get saved and no emails will be sent. This is the key to tricking bots into believing everything went smoothly.

## Using AJAX

To submit the form with AJAX, be sure to pass all the form inputs in with the submission, as Statamic sets `_token` and `_params`, both of which are required.

You'll also need to set your ajax library's `X-Requested-With` header to `XMLHttpRequest'.

### Axios Example

``` javascript
window.axios.defaults.headers.common['X-Requested-With'] = 'XMLHttpRequest';
form = document.getElementById('form');

// On submit...
axios.post(form.action, new FormData(form))
  .then(response => {
      console.log(response.data)
  });
```
