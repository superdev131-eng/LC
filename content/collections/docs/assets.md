## Overview
Assets are grouped into containers and can have their own fieldsets attached to manage extra data and information. For example:

- Images can have alt tags, captions, and display controls.
- Videos can have transcripts, descriptions, and credits.
- Zip files can have descriptions and MD5sums.
