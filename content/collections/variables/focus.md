The focal point of the asset, defaulting to center (`50-50`).

```
{{ focus }}
```

```html
50-30
```

You may want to use this in CSS with either the [background_position](/modifiers/background_position) modifier, or just by using the [focus_css](/variables/focus_css) variable.

```
background-position: {{ focus | background_position }};
background-position: {{ focus_css }};
```

```html
background-position: 50% 30%;
background-position: 50% 30%;
```
