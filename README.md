## Statamic 3 Beta Documentation

This is the source of the official [Statamic 3 Beta docs][docs].


## Local Development

If you want to work on this project on your local machine, you may follow the instructions below. These instructions assume you are serving the site using [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/valet) out of your `~/Sites` directory:

1. Fork this repository
2. Open your terminal and cd to your `~/Sites` folder
3. Clone your fork into the `~/Sites/docs` folder, by running the following command with your username placed into the {username} slot:
    git clone git@github.com:{username}/docs statamic-docs
4. CD into the new directory you just created.
5. Run `npm install && npm run dev`.

## Open Beta

Statamic 3 is now in **open beta!** We welcome you try it out, [read the docs](https://statamic.dev), experiment, send [bug reports][contribution], provide thoughtful feedback, and otherwise do anything you feel will make the platform better and more stable for launch.

If this is your first experience with Statamic, please reserve your final judgement until we're out of beta. We've built a solid and flexible foundation and most bugs and rough edges should be minor efforts to address.

Statamic 3 has extensive (in progress) [documentation][docs], and this is the repo for them. We dedicate a significant amount of time and energy every day to improving them, so if something is unclear, wait a day or two and check back again. If it's still confusing, feel free to open an issue or chat with us on [Discord][discord] about it!
